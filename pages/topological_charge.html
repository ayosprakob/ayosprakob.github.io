    <h2>About the topological charge</h2>

    <div id="anchors"></div>

    <section label="summary">Summary</section>

    Topological charge is an observable that measures non-perturbative properties of the gauge field configuration. In even dimensions $d$, the topological charge is given by
    $$
    Q = \alpha_{d}\int_\mathcal{M}d^{d}x~\epsilon^{\mu_1\cdots\mu_d}~\text{Tr}~F_{\mu_1\mu_2}\cdots F_{\mu_{d-1}\mu_d}
    $$
    where $\alpha_{d}$ is some coefficient and $\mathcal{M}$ is the base manifold. It can be written more conveniently as a differential form as
    $$
    Q=\alpha_{d}\int_{\mathcal{M}}\text{Tr}~F^{d/2}.
    $$
    The topological charge is quantized. In 2 dimensions, only $U(1)$ gauge theory has a non-trivial topological structure, while in 4 dimensions, only $SU(N)$ has.
    <nl>
    Specifically, the topological charge for 2d $U(1)$ and 4d $SU(N)$ take the form
    $$
    Q=\left\{
      \begin{array}{l}
      \displaystyle
      \frac{1}{4\pi}\epsilon^{\mu\nu}~\int d^2xF_{\mu\nu}&;\;\text{2d},\\
      \displaystyle
      \frac{1}{32\pi^2}\epsilon^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}~\int d^4x\text{Tr}~F_{\mu\nu}F_{\rho\sigma}&;\;\text{4d}.
      \end{array}
      \right.
    $$
    In the following sections, I will spend some time discussing why the topological charge only exists in some combination of dimensions and gauge groups. I will also determine the coefficient $\alpha_{d}$ at least for $d=2$ and $4$.

    <section label="chern-simon">Chern-Simon form</section>

    First of all, it is known that the topological charge can be written as a surface integral of a Chern-Simon form
    $$
    Q = \alpha_d \int_{\mathcal{M}}\text{d}\omega_{d-1} = d\times\alpha_d\int_{\partial\mathcal{M}}\omega_{d-1}.
    $$
    The extra factor $d$ comes from the embedding of $\omega_{d-1}$ in $\mathcal{M}$ onto $\partial\mathcal{M}$.
    <box>
      In case it is not clear, here is more explanation. We start with
      $$
      \text{d}\omega=\epsilon^{\mu_1\cdots\mu_d}\partial_{\mu_1}\omega_{\mu_2\cdots\mu_d}\text{d}x^1\wedge\cdots\wedge\text{d}x^d\quad(\text{on}~S^d)
      $$
      which is a $d$-form on $S^d$. With the Strokes' theorem, we instead have
      $$
      \omega=\epsilon^{\mu_1\cdots\mu_d}\hat n_{\mu_1}\omega_{\mu_2\cdots\mu_d}\text{d}y^1\wedge\cdots\wedge\text{d}y^{d-1}\quad(\text{on}~S^d)
      $$
      which is a $(d-1)$-form, still on $S^d$. $\text{d}y^i$ are the coordinates on $S^{d-1}$ and $\hat n$ is a vector normal to the surface $S^{d-1}$. To embed this onto $S^{d-1}$, we have to trace out the index $\mu_1$, which is normal to $S^{d-1}$. This gives the extra factor $d$ because $\hat n$ is a unit vector. And the Chern-Simon form becomes
      $$
      \omega=\epsilon^{i_1\cdots i_{d-1}}
      \omega_{i_1\cdots i_{d-1}}\text{d}y^1\wedge\cdots\wedge\text{d}y^{d-1}.\quad(\text{on}~S^{d-1})
      $$

    </box>
    I don't know how to nicely prove that there always exist this Chern-Simon form in arbitrary dimensions, but you can easily confirm this for up to $d=6$:
    $$
    \text{d}\omega_{d-1} &= \text{Tr}~F^{d/2};\\
    \omega_1&=\text{Tr}A,\\
    \omega_3&=\text{Tr}\left(A\text{d}A+\frac{2i}{3}A^3\right),\\
    \omega_5&=\text{Tr}\left(A(\text{d}A)^2+\frac{3i}{2} A^3\text{d}A -\frac{3}{5}A^5\right),
    $$
    where $F=dA+iA^2$. Note that some terms such as $\text{Tr}(A\text{d}A A\text{d}A)$ or $\text{Tr}A^2$ vanish because of the antisymmetricity of the exterior products.

    Typically, we are actually interested in <note value="Open boundaries do not have a proper topological structure, so we will ignore it.">either of the following</note>: a closed base manifold or an infinitely extended base manifold with the condition that all fields vanish at the infinity. The second case can also be considered as a $d$-sphere $S^d$ with the infinity identified as one of the poles.

    We will now argue that the boundary $\partial\mathcal{M}$ for both cases can always be chosen to be homotopic to a $(d-1)$-sphere that can be shrunk to zero volume.
    <box>
    <b>Proof</b><br>
    The argument is rather simple. Instead of considering an integral over a closed manifold $\mathcal{M}$, we consider an integral over an open manifold $\mathcal{V}\subset\mathcal{M}$ such that $\mathcal{V}$ is $\mathcal{M}$ with a spherical puncture. As we take the limit where the puncture is shrunk to zero volume, we obtain the original integral over $\mathcal{M}$. Since the puncture is a $d$-ball, its boundary is a $(d-1)$-sphere<cite src="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_(mathematics)"></cite>. $Q.E.D.$
    </box>

    So the boundary $\partial\mathcal{M}$ actually should vanish in both cases. Naively, we therefore also expect $Q$ to also vanish. But actually, there is an exception to this when the integrand involves a multivalued function. Let's investigate this more carefully next.

    <section label="homotopy">Homotopy group</section>

    Consider an integral of a function $\omega(x)$ around a puncture $\partial\mathcal{M}=\gamma$
    $$
    I_\gamma = \oint_\gamma dx~\omega(x)
    $$
    We now assume that $I_\gamma$ is <note value="Example: logarithm is multivalued with period 2&pi;">multivalued with period $\Lambda$</note>:
    $$
    I_\gamma = \text{pv}\left[\oint_\gamma dx~\omega(x)\right]+q\Lambda;\quad q\in\mathbb{Z},
    $$
    where $\text{pv}[~\cdot~]$ is the principal value. Shrinking the puncture to zero makes the principal value vanish, leaving only the quantized term $q\Lambda$
    $$
    I_0 = q\Lambda.
    $$
    What kind of $\omega(x)$ gives the integral with this property? The simplest example is when $\omega(x)$ is a total derivative of a multivalued function with period $\Lambda$:
    $$
    \omega(x) = \partial_x f(x)
    $$
    If we take $\gamma$ to be a circle $x\in[-\pi,\pi)$ and $f(x)$ to be periodic on $\gamma$ modulo $\Lambda$; $f(x+2\pi)\equiv f(x)~(\text{mod}~\Lambda)$, then we have
    $$
    I_\gamma=\int_{-\pi}^{\pi}dx \partial_xf(x)=f(\pi)-f(-\pi)=q\Lambda.
    $$
    Here, the integer $q$ counts the number of times $f(x)$ crosses the branch cuts in the interval $x\in[-\pi,\pi)$. Another way to imagine this is to consider $f(x)$ as a map from $\gamma$ (a circle with radius $1$) onto another circle (with radius $\Lambda/2\pi$). Then $q$ counts the number of times the first circle wraps around the second circle.
    <nl>
    Let us try to generalize this statement. Let $\int\omega$ be a map from a space-time manifold $\partial\mathcal{M}$ onto the group manifold $\mathcal{G}$, then the existence of nonzero topological charge depends on wheter or not we can wrap $\partial\mathcal{M}$ around $\mathcal{G}$ in a non-trivial way. This problem can be catagorized by an object called the <i>homotopy group</i> $[\partial\mathcal{M},\mathcal{G}]$<cite src="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotopy_group"></cite>. In the previous example, it is known that the homotopy group of a map between two 1-spheres is $[S^1,S^1]=\mathbb{Z}$. This means that all possible distinct ways to wrap the circles can be parametrized by an integer $q$. For a map from $S^m$ to $S^n$, the homotopy group is typically denoted by $\pi_m(S^n):=[S^m,S^n]$.
    <nl>
    Before we summarize, let us state again that, in $d$-dimensions, we consider $\partial\mathcal{M}\simeq S^{d-1}$. We also note that $U(1)\simeq S^1$ and $SU(2)\simeq S^3$. Mapping onto other non-Abelian groups can be shown to be homotopic to a mapping onto one of their $SU(2)$ subgroups. This is a result from Bott periodicity theorem<cite src="https://inspirehep.net/literature/37141"></cite>. Here is a summarized table of important homotopy groups and their implications:

    <section label="coefficient">Determining the coefficients</section>

    So far, we have argued that the topological charge should vanish up to some quantization term related to the homotopy group. What it means is the topological charge should not change its value by a continuous change of the gauge field except when the change is too large that it crosses some singularity that makes the topological charge discontinuously jump to another value. With this in mind, let us consider the simplest gauge configuration so that our computation is the easiest:
    $$
    A_\mu = -ig^{-1}\partial_\mu g
    $$
    for some $g\in G$. Since this is nothing but a gauge transformation of $A_\mu=0$ with $V=g^{-1}$, we can easily show that the curvature form $F=\text{d}A+iA\wedge A$ vanishes, and thus
    $$
    A\wedge A = i\text{d}A.
    $$
    In what follows, we will consider the following gauge choice in our calculation:
    $$
    g = \left\{
      \begin{array}{ll}
      \exp(iq\phi)&;\text{2d}~U(1),\\
      \exp(-iq\chi\sigma\cdot\hat x)&;\text{4d}~SU(N),
      \end{array}
      \right.
    $$
    where $\phi\in[-\pi,\pi)$ is the $U(1)$ angle and
    $$
    \hat x&=(\sin\theta\cos\phi,\sin\theta\sin\phi,\cos\theta);\\
    \phi&\in[-\pi,\pi),\\
    \theta&\in[0,\pi),\\
    \chi&\in[0,\pi),
    $$
    is the unit vector on $S^3$. Also, $\sigma_a$ are the Pauli matrices (or the $\mathfrak{su}(2)$ subalgebra of $\mathfrak{su}(N)$ with the same normalization as the Pauli matrices). The parameter $q$ is an integer parametrizing the wrapping number.
    <nl>
    For 2d $U(1)$, this is very simple. First we recognize that $\partial\mathcal{M}\simeq S^1$. The topological charge becomes
    $$
    Q &= 2\alpha_2\int_{S^1}A\\
    &= 2\alpha_2\int_{S^1}A_\phi d\phi\\
    &= 2\alpha_2\int_{S^1}g^{-1}\partial_\phi g d\phi\\
    &=-2i\alpha_2 \log(g(\pi)g^{-1}(-\pi))\\
    &= \alpha_2\times4q\pi.
    $$
    The topological charge becomes an integer when $\alpha_2=1/4\pi$, which is what we were trying to prove.
    <nl>
    Now for 4d $SU(N)$, we can rewrite the Chern-Simon form for the pure gauge configuration as
    $$
    \omega_3 = \text{Tr}\left(A\text{d}A+\frac{2i}{3}A^3\right)
    = -\frac{i}{3}\text{Tr}(A^3)
    = \frac{1}{3}\text{Tr}(g^{-1}\text{d}gg^{-1}\text{d}gg^{-1}\text{d}g).
    $$

    Next, we rewrite $g$ as
    $$
    g &= \cos\alpha+i\sin\alpha u;\\
    \alpha &:= -q\chi,\\
    u &:= \sigma\cdot\hat x.
    $$
    Since
    $$
    \text{d}g = -\sin\alpha \text{d}\alpha + i\cos\alpha u \text{d}\alpha + i\sin\alpha \text{d}u,
    $$
    and using the identity $u^2=(\sigma\cdot\hat x)^2=\hat x\cdot\hat x = 1$, we have
    $$
    g^{-1}\text{d}g = iu\text{d}\alpha+\frac{i}{2}\sin(2\alpha)\text{d}u+\sin^2\alpha u\text{d}u.
    $$
    Fun fact, the 1-form $g^{-1}\text{d}g$ is known as the Wess–Zumino–Witten form, which we will further rewrite as
    $$
      g^{-1}\text{d}g = i\Omega^i\sigma_i.
    $$
    To compute $\Omega^i$, we first note that
    $$
    u\text{d}u=(\hat x\cdot\sigma)(\text{d}\hat x\cdot\sigma)= i(\hat x\times \text{d}\hat x)\cdot\sigma.
    $$
    Collectively, we have
    $$
    g^{-1}\text{d}g = i\left[\hat x^a\text{d}\alpha+\frac{1}{2}\sin(2\alpha)\text{d}\hat x^a+\sin^2\alpha(\hat x\times \text{d}\hat x)^a\right]\sigma_a,
    $$
    and thus
    $$
    \Omega^a = \hat x^a\text{d}\alpha+\frac{1}{2}\sin(2\alpha)\text{d}\hat x^a+\sin^2\alpha(\hat x\times \text{d}\hat x)^a.
    $$
    We are now ready to compute $\omega_3$:
    $$
    \omega_3 &= \frac{1}{3}\text{Tr}~(g^{-1}\text{d}g)^3\\
    &=\frac{i}{3}\Omega^a\wedge\Omega^b\wedge\Omega^c\wedge\text{Tr}~(\sigma_a\sigma_b\sigma_c)\\
    &=-\frac{2}{3}\Omega^a\wedge\Omega^b\wedge\Omega^c\epsilon_{abc}\\
    &=-4\Omega^1\wedge\Omega^2\wedge\Omega^3\\
    &=-4 \sin^2\alpha\sin\theta~\text{d}\alpha\wedge\text{d}\theta\wedge\text{d}\phi
    $$
    You can get the final line with the following commands in <verb>Mathematica</verb>:
    <nl>
    <pre><code>
      x = {Sin[&theta;]*Cos[&phi;], Sin[&theta;]*Sin[&phi;], Cos[&theta;]};
      dx = D[x, &theta;]*d&theta; + D[x, &phi;]*d&phi;;
      &Omega; = x*d&alpha; + Sin[&alpha;]*Cos[&alpha;]*dx + (Sin[&alpha;]*Sin[&alpha;])*Cross[x, dx];
      OneForm[A_] := {D[A,d&alpha;]/.{d&theta;->0,d&phi;->0}, 
                      D[A,d&theta;]/.{d&alpha;->0,d&phi;->0}, 
                      D[A,d&phi;]/.{d&theta;->0,d&alpha;->0}};
      J = Transpose@Join[{OneForm[&Omega;[[1]]], OneForm[&Omega;[[2]]],OneForm[&Omega;[[3]]]}];
      Simplify[Det[J]]
    </code></pre>
    <nl>
    Finally, we substitute $\alpha=-q\chi$ and obtain
    $$
    \omega_3 = 4qi \sin^2(q\chi)\sin\theta~\text{d}\chi\wedge\text{d}\theta\wedge\text{d}\phi.
    $$
    The topological charge can then be evaluated as
    $$
    Q &= 4\alpha_4\int_{S^3}\omega_3\\
    &= 16q\alpha_4\int_0^\pi\sin^2(q\chi)d\chi\int_0^\pi\sin(\theta)d\theta\int_{-\pi}^\pi d\phi\\
    &= 32\pi^2q\alpha_4.
    $$
    To get the integer topological charge, we need to set $\alpha_4=1/32\pi^2$, which is what we tried to prove.
