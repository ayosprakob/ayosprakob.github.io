    <h2>About topological charge</h2>

    <div id="anchors"></div>

    In this section, we will derive some known properties of the topological charge in even dimensions. At the beginning, I will use the differential form<cite src="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_form"></cite> for notational simplicity, then I will switch to the usual coefficient notation when we discuss specific cases.

    <section anchor="quantization">Quantization</section>

    In $d=2n$ dimensions, the topological charge is given by
    $$
    Q = \alpha_{2n}\int_\mathcal{M} \text{Tr}F^n.
    $$
    Here, $F=\text{d}A+iA\wedge A$ is the curvature form, $F^{n}$ means the $n$-th power with respect to the exterior product, $\int_\mathcal{M}$ is the volume integral over the manifold $\mathcal{M}$, and $\alpha_{2n}$ is some coefficient that we will fix later.
    The integrand can be expressed as a sum of $2n$-forms
    $$
    \text{Tr}F^n=\sum_{k=1}^{n} f_k\text{Tr}\{A^{2k-2}\wedge (\text{d}A)^{n-k+1}\}
    $$
    for some coefficients $f_k$. Also, remember that $\text{Tr}A^{2n}=0$ because the cyclic property of the trace is incompatible with the even exterior power, so there is no $k=n+1$ in the sum. Note that
    $$
    A^{2k-2}\wedge (\text{d}A)^{n-k+1}=\frac{1}{2k-1}\text{d}(A^{2k-1}\wedge (\text{d}A)^{n-k}).
    $$
    It follows that the topological charge is an integral of a total derivative
    \begin{align}
    Q &= \alpha_{2n}\int_{\mathcal{M}} \text{d}\omega_{2n-1};\\
    \omega_{2n-1}&=\sum_{k=1}^n\frac{f_k}{2k-1}\text{Tr}\{A^{2k-1}\wedge (\text{d}A)^{n-k}\}.
    \end{align}
    The object $\omega_p$ is known as the Chern-Simon $p$-form.
    <nl>
    The topological charge is now replaced by the surface integral
    $$
    Q = \alpha_{2n}\int_{\partial\mathcal{M}} \omega_{2n-1}.
    $$
    We will now restrict ourselves to one of these two cases:
    <ul>
      <li> Compact manifold
      <li> Infinite manifold with all fields vanishing at the infinity
    </ul>
    Open manifolds have totally different topological physics, so we will leave the discussions for other sections. The second case can be considered as a sphere with the infinity identified as one of the poles; $\mathbb{R}^d\cup\{\infty\}\simeq S^d$. In any case, we will now argue that the boundary $\partial\mathcal{M}$ for both cases can always be chosen to be homotopic to a $(d-1)$-sphere that can be shrunk to zero volume.
    <nl>
    The argument is rather simple. Instead of considering an integral over a closed manifold $\mathcal{M}$, we consider an integral over an open manifold $\mathcal{V}\subset\mathcal{M}$ such that $\mathcal{V}$ is $\mathcal{M}$ with a spherical puncture. As we take the limit where the puncture is shrunk to zero volume, we obtain the original integral over $\mathcal{M}$. Since the puncture is a $d$-ball, its boundary is a $(d-1)$-sphere<cite src="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_(mathematics)"></cite>. $Q.E.D.$
    <nl>
    The remaining question now is: what happens to the surface integral over a shrinking $(d-1)$-sphere? Naively, you would think that the integral becomes zero. But as we will see, this may not be true when $\int\omega_{2n-1}$ is a multivalued function.

    <section anchor="homotopy">Homotopy groups</section>

    Consider an integral of a function $\omega(x)$ around a puncture $\partial\mathcal{M}=\gamma$
    $$
    I_\gamma = \oint_\gamma dx~\omega(x)
    $$
    We now assume that $I_\gamma$ is <note value="Example: logarithm is multivalued with period 2&pi;">multivalued with period $\Lambda$</note>:
    $$
    I_\gamma = \text{pv}\left[\oint_\gamma dx~\omega(x)\right]+q\Lambda;\quad q\in\mathbb{Z},
    $$
    where $\text{pv}[~\cdot~]$ is the principal value. Shrinking the puncture to zero makes the principal value vanish, leaving only the quantized term $q\Lambda$
    $$
    I_0 = q\Lambda.
    $$
    What kind of $\omega(x)$ gives the integral with this property? The simplest example is when $\omega(x)$ is a total derivative of a multivalued function with period $\Lambda$:
    $$
    \omega(x) = \partial_x f(x)
    $$
    If we take $\gamma$ to be a circle $x\in[0,2\pi)$ and $f(x)$ to be periodic on $\gamma$ modulo $\Lambda$; $f(x+2\pi)\equiv f(x)~(\text{mod}~\Lambda)$, then we have
    $$
    I_\gamma=\int_0^{2\pi}dx \partial_xf(x)=f(2\pi)-f(0)=q\Lambda.
    $$
    Here, the integer $q$ counts the number of times $f(x)$ crosses the branch cuts in the interval $x\in[0,2\pi)$. Another way to imagine this is to consider $f(x)$ as a map from $\gamma$ (a circle with radius $1$) onto another circle (with radius $\Lambda/2\pi$). Then $q$ counts the number of times the first circle wraps around the second circle.
    <nl>
    Let us try to generalize this statement. Let $\int\omega$ be a map from a space-time manifold $\partial\mathcal{M}$ onto the group manifold $\mathcal{G}$, then the existence of nonzero topological charge depends on wheter or not we can wrap $\partial\mathcal{M}$ around $\mathcal{G}$ in a non-trivial way. This problem can be catagorized by an object called the <i>homotopy group</i> $[\partial\mathcal{M},\mathcal{G}]$<cite src="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotopy_group"></cite>. In the previous example, it is known that the homotopy group of a map between two 1-spheres is $[S^1,S^1]=\mathbb{Z}$. This means that all possible distinct ways to wrap the circles can be parametrized by an integer $q$. For a map from $S^m$ to $S^n$, the homotopy group is typically denoted by $\pi_m(S^n):=[S^m,S^n]$.
    <nl>
    Before we summarize, let us state again that, in $d$-dimensions, we consider $\partial\mathcal{M}\simeq S^{d-1}$. We also note that $U(1)\simeq S^1$ and $SU(2)\simeq S^3$. Mapping onto other non-Abelian groups can be shown to be homotopic to a mapping onto one of their $SU(2)$ subgroups. This is from Botts theorem<cite src="https://inspirehep.net/literature/37141"></cite>. Here is a summarized table of important homotopy groups and their implications:

    We will now turn our attention to the two non-trivial cases on the table: 2d $U(1)$ and 4d $SU(N)$ gauge theories.

    <section anchor="2du1">2d $U(1)$</section>
    The $U(1)$ topological charge in 2 dimensions reads
    \begin{align}
    Q&=\alpha_2\int_\mathcal{M}d^2x~\epsilon^{\mu\nu}F_{\mu\nu}
    &(\text{volume form})\\
    &=\alpha_2 \lim_{r\rightarrow0}r\int_{-\pi}^\pi d\theta~\epsilon^{\mu\nu}n_\mu A_\nu
    &(\text{surface form})
    \end{align}
    where $n_\mu$ is the normal vector perpendicular to the surface $\partial\mathcal{M}\simeq S^1$. The measure $\int_{-\pi}^\pi d\theta$ is the surface integration measure for $S^1$. And finally, the limit $r\rightarrow0$ corresponds to taking the zero puncture limit.
    <nl>
    We will consider the gauge field around the puncture to take the form
    $$
    A_\mu = A^\text{avr}_\mu - ig^{-1}\partial_\mu g
    $$
    where $A^\text{avr}_\mu$ is the average part of the gauge field along $\partial\mathcal{M}$, which will cancel out in the integral. As for the gauge transformation part, we need $g\in U(1)$ to be periodic along $\partial\mathcal{M}$, so we consider
    $$g(r,\theta) = \exp(i q\theta ),$$
    giving
    \begin{align}
    Q &= i\alpha_2 \lim_{r\rightarrow0}r\int_{-\pi}^\pi d\theta~\frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}\log g\\
    &= \alpha_2 \lim_{r\rightarrow0}\int_{-\pi}^\pi d\theta~q\\
    &=2\pi q\alpha_2.
    \end{align}
    From this result, we set $\alpha_2=1/{2\pi}$ so that $Q$ is integer-valued.

      <b>Summary for 2d $U(1)$:</b>
      \begin{align}
      Q&=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_\mathcal{M} d^2x \epsilon^{\mu\nu}F_{\mu\nu},\\
      \omega^\mu_1&=\epsilon^{\mu\nu}A_\nu
      \end{align}
    </box>

    <section anchor="4dsu2">4d $SU(2)$</section>

    The $SU(2)$ topological charge in 4 dimensions reads
    \begin{align}
    Q&=\alpha_4\int_\mathcal{M}d^4x~\epsilon^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}\text{Tr}F_{\mu\nu}F_{\rho\sigma}
    &(\text{volume form})\\
    &=\alpha_4 \lim_{r\rightarrow0}r\int_{S^3} d\Omega_3~\epsilon^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}
    n_\mu
    \text{Tr}\left(A_\nu \partial_\rho A_\sigma+\frac{2i}{3} A_\nu A_\rho A_\sigma\right).
    &(\text{surface form})
    \end{align}

    We will consider the pure gauge $A_\mu = -ig^{-1}\partial_\mu g$ for simplicity. It this gauge, the field strength vanishes
    \begin{align}
    F &= \text{d}A + iA\wedge A\\
    &= \text{d}(-ig^{-1}\text{d}g)+i(-ig^{-1}\text{d}g)\wedge(-ig^{-1}\text{d}g)\\
    &= -i\text{d}g^{-1}\wedge \text{d}g-i(g^{-1}\text{d}g)\wedge(g^{-1}\text{d}g)\\
    &= -i(-g^{-1}\text{d}gg^{-1})\wedge \text{d}g-i(g^{-1}\text{d}g)\wedge(g^{-1}\text{d}g)=0,
    \end{align}
    where we have used the fact that $\text{d}g^{-1}=-g^{-1}\text{d}gg^{-1}$ (which comes from $\text{d}(gg^{-1})=0$).
    <nl>
    One consequence of this is that we are considering the local minima of the kinetic action $\int F\wedge\star F$, a.k.a. the classical solutions. Adding small $A^\text{avr}$ to the gauge field will slightly increase the action, but will not change the topological charge since, from our earlier discussion, the charge is quantized. In any case, since $F=0$ in this case, we have a nice relation
    $$
    dA = -iA\wedge A\quad\text{(pure gauge).}
    $$
    Plugging this into the Chern-Simon term gives
    \begin{align}
    \omega^\mu_3 &= -\frac{i}{3}\epsilon^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}
    \text{Tr}\left(A_\nu A_\rho A_\sigma\right)\\
    &=\frac{1}{3}\epsilon^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}
    \text{Tr}\left(
    g^{-1}\partial_\nu g
    g^{-1}\partial_\rho g
    g^{-1}\partial_\sigma g
    \right)
    \end{align}
    Since we will take $n_\mu$ to be orthonormal to the surface $\partial\mathcal{M}=S^3$, we can simply consider only the 3d components of the Chern-Simon form:
    $$
    \omega_3 = \frac{1}{3}\epsilon^{ijk}
    \text{Tr}\left(
    g^{-1}\partial_i g
    g^{-1}\partial_j g
    g^{-1}\partial_k g
    \right)
    $$
    so that
    $$
    Q = \alpha_4 \int_{S^3} d\Omega_3~\omega_3.
    $$
    (now what...)
