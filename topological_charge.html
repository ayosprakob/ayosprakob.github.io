      There are a few things in this page that I made up:
      <ul>
        <li> Using a simple line integral of a multi-valued function as an analogy for Yang-Mills homotopy class.
        <li> Considering $\partial\mathcal{M}_d\sim S^{d-1}$ because we will eventually consider instantons.
      </ul>
      I'm not sure if these are correct assumptions. I will remove this notice when I confirm the details later.
    </div>

    In this section, we will derive some known properties of the topological charge in even dimensions. At the beginning, I will use the differential form<cite src="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_form"></cite> for simplicity, then I will switch to the usual coefficient notation when we discuss specific cases.

    <section anchor="quantization">Quantization</section>

    In $d=2n$ dimensions, the topological charge is given by
    $$
    Q = \alpha_{2n}\int_\mathcal{M} \text{Tr}F^n.
    $$
    Here, $F=\text{d}A+iA\wedge A$ is the curvature form, $F^{n}$ means the $n$-th power with respect to the exterior product, $\int_\mathcal{M}$ is the volume integral over the manifold $\mathcal{M}$, and $\alpha_{2n}$ is some coefficient that we will fix later.
    The integrand can be expressed as a sum of $2n$-forms
    $$
    \text{Tr}F^n=\sum_{k=1}^{n} f_k\text{Tr}\{A^{2k-2}\wedge (\text{d}A)^{n-k+1}\}
    $$
    for some coefficients $f_k$. Also, remember that $\text{Tr}A^{2n}=0$ because the cyclic property of the trace is incompatible with the even exterior power, so there is no $k=n+1$ in the sum. Note that
    $$
    A^{2k-2}\wedge (\text{d}A)^{n-k+1}=\frac{1}{2k-1}\text{d}(A^{2k-1}\wedge (\text{d}A)^{n-k}).
    $$
    It follows that the topological charge is a total derivative
    \begin{align}
    Q &= \alpha_{2n}\int_{\mathcal{M}} \text{d}\omega_{2n-1};\\
    \omega_{2n-1}&=\sum_{k=1}^n\frac{f_k}{2k-1}\text{Tr}\{A^{2k-1}\wedge (\text{d}A)^{n-k}\}.
    \end{align}
    The object $\omega_p$ is known as the Chern-Simon $p$-form.
    <br><br>
    The topological charge is now replaced by the surface integral
    $$
    Q = \alpha_{2n}\int_{\partial\mathcal{M}} \omega_{2n-1}.
    $$
    In field theories, this usually falls into one of the two categories
    <ul>
      <li> Compact manifold
      <li> Infinite manifold with all fields vanishing at the infinity
    </ul>
    You can consider the second case to be an $S^d$ where all fields vanish at one pole (identified as infinity). In any case, typically, a surface integral on a closed manifold usually ends up being zero because there is no boundary (or the boundary shrinks to zero, if you take the limit). But there is an exception when the integrand is a multivalued function, then the integral becomes quantized.
    <br><br>
    Consider a very simple example
    $$
    I=\int_0^1 dx \partial_x f(x);\qquad f(x)\equiv f(x+1)~(\text{mod}~\lambda).
    $$
    The periodicity condition implies that it is acceptable if the difference $f(x+1)-f(x)$ is an integer multiple of $\lambda$. Then the integral can be evaluated as
    $$
    I = f(1)-f(0) = q\lambda;\quad q\in\mathbb{Z}
    $$
    Here, $q$ is the winding number, indicating how often the function $f(x)$ winds around each branch in the interval $x\in[0,1)$.
    <br><br>
    Similarly for our case, if we allow the Chern-Simon form to be multivalued, then we have
    $$
    Q = q;\quad q\in\mathbb{Z},
    $$
    where we have chosen the coefficient $\alpha_{2n}$ so that $Q$ is integer-valued. Whether the gauge field can have nontrivial winding and with what value of $\lambda$ depends on the gauge group and the dimensionality of the space-time.

    Another way to understand how to count the wrapping number of a multivalued function on a manifold is to view of it as counting different ways we can map a manifold on another manifold. This sounds confusing, but let me go back to the previous example for clarity.
    <br><br>
    When we have a function $f(x)$ that is periodic with period $1$ modulo $\lambda$, we are considering a mapping between two circles. <note value="Or more precisely, homotopically.">Topologically</note>, $f(x)$ is a map from $S^1$ with radius $1/2\pi$ to another  $S^1$ with radius $\lambda/2\pi$. If $f(x)$ crosses the branch cut $n$ times for $x\in[0,1)$, we can be sure that $f(x)~\text{mod}~\lambda$ will pass a certain value $\lambda'\in[0,\lambda)$ $n$ times (crossing the opposite direction counts as negative). This can be translated to saying that $f(x)$ corresponds to the wrapping of a circle to another circle with $n$ wrapping. In general, counting the wrapping of a map from $\mathcal{M}_1$ to $\mathcal{M}_2$ is described by an object called a <i>homotopy group</i> $[\mathcal{M}_1,\mathcal{M}_2]$ (this is not a commutator). For homotopy groups between spheres, a more common symbol is $\pi_m(S^n):=[S^m,S^n]$. In this example, the homotopy group is
    $$\pi_1(S^1)=\mathbb{Z}$$
    which indicates that the number of times you can wrap one circle over another circle in a homotopically distinct way can be any integer.
    <br><br>
    The followings are some of the useful homotopy groups:
    <ul>
      <li> $\pi_{n}(S^1)=\{0\};\quad n>1$
      <li> $[S^n,S^n]=\pi_n(S^n)=\mathbb{Z}$
      <li> $[T^n,S^n]\simeq\pi_n(S^n)=\mathbb{Z}$
      <li> $[U(1),S^1]\simeq\pi_1(S^1)=\mathbb{Z}$
      <li> $[SU(N),S^3]\simeq[SU(2),S^3]\simeq\pi_3(S^3)=\mathbb{Z}$
    </ul>
    Note that, for $SU(N)$, it is sufficient to consider the $SU(2)$ subgroup&mdash;thus the last relation.
    <br><br>
    In 2 dimensions, the topological charge is a surface integral over $\partial \mathcal{M}_2$
    for some closed manifold $\mathcal{M}_2$. As we will discuss later, we are particularly interested in the situation where the gauge field <note value="To be more specific, we are interested in certain local structures of gauge field.">'vanishes at the boundary'</note>. Then we can take $\partial\mathcal{M}_2\sim S^1$. The only unitary gauge group allowed to have non-trivial topological structure is therefore the $U(1)$ gauge theory since $[SU(N),S^1]\simeq[SU(2),S^1]\simeq\pi_2(S^1)=\{0\}$.
    <br><br>
    In 4 dimensions, we can take $\partial\mathcal{M}_4\sim S^3$, for which the only nontrivial homotopy group is $[SU(N),S^3]\simeq\pi_3(S^3)=\mathbb{Z}$. Unlike in 2 dimensions, $U(1)$ gauge theory does not have non-trivial topological structures.
