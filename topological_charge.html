    <h2>About topological charge</h2>

    <div id="anchors"></div>

    In this section, we will derive some known properties of the topological charge in even dimensions. At the beginning, I will use the differential form <cite src="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_form"></cite> for notational simplicity, then I will switch to the usual coefficient notation when we discuss specific cases.

    <section anchor="quantization">Quantization</section>

    In $d=2n$ dimensions, the topological charge is given by
    $$
    Q = \alpha_{2n}\int_\mathcal{M} \text{Tr}F^n.
    $$
    Here, $F=\text{d}A+iA\wedge A$ is the curvature form, $F^{n}$ means the $n$-th power with respect to the exterior product, $\int_\mathcal{M}$ is the volume integral over the manifold $\mathcal{M}$, and $\alpha_{2n}$ is some coefficient that we will fix later.
    The integrand can be expressed as a sum of $2n$-forms
    $$
    \text{Tr}F^n=\sum_{k=1}^{n} f_k\text{Tr}\{A^{2k-2}\wedge (\text{d}A)^{n-k+1}\}
    $$
    for some coefficients $f_k$. Also, remember that $\text{Tr}A^{2n}=0$ because the cyclic property of the trace is incompatible with the even exterior power, so there is no $k=n+1$ in the sum. Note that
    $$
    A^{2k-2}\wedge (\text{d}A)^{n-k+1}=\frac{1}{2k-1}\text{d}(A^{2k-1}\wedge (\text{d}A)^{n-k}).
    $$
    It follows that the topological charge is an integral of a total derivative
    \begin{align}
    Q &= \alpha_{2n}\int_{\mathcal{M}} \text{d}\omega_{2n-1};\\
    \omega_{2n-1}&=\sum_{k=1}^n\frac{f_k}{2k-1}\text{Tr}\{A^{2k-1}\wedge (\text{d}A)^{n-k}\}.
    \end{align}
    The object $\omega_p$ is known as the Chern-Simon $p$-form.
    <br><br>
    The topological charge is now replaced by the surface integral
    $$
    Q = \alpha_{2n}\int_{\partial\mathcal{M}} \omega_{2n-1}.
    $$
    We will now restrict ourselves to one of these two cases:
    <ul>
      <li> Compact manifold
      <li> Infinite manifold with all fields vanishing at the infinity
    </ul>
    Open manifolds have totally different topological physics, so we will leave the discussions for other sections. The second case can be considered as a sphere with the infinity identified as one of the poles; $\mathbb{R}^d\cup\{\infty\}\simeq S^d$. In any case, we will now argue that the boundary $\partial\mathcal{M}$ for both cases can always be chosen to be homotopic to a $(d-1)$-sphere that can be shrunk to zero volume.
    <br><br>
    The argument is rather simple. Instead of considering an integral over a closed manifold $\mathcal{M}$, we consider an integral over an open manifold $\mathcal{V}\subset\mathcal{M}$ such that $\mathcal{V}$ is $\mathcal{M}$ with a spherical puncture. As we take the limit where the puncture is shrunk to zero volume, we obtain the original integral over $\mathcal{M}$. Since the puncture is a $d$-ball, its boundary is a $(d-1)$-sphere <cite src="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_(mathematics)"></cite>. $Q.E.D.$
    <br><br>
    The remaining question now is: what happens to the surface integral over a shrinking $(d-1)$-sphere? Naively, you would think that the integral becomes zero. But as we will see, this may not be true when $\omega_{2n-1}$ is a multivalued function.

    <section anchor="homotopy">Homotopy groups</section>

    Consider an integral of a multivalued function $\omega(x)$ around a puncture $\gamma$
    $$
    I_\gamma = \oint_\gamma dx~\omega(x)
    $$
    Assuming that $\omega(x)$ is <note value="Example: logarithm is multivalued with period 2&pi;">multivalued with period $\Lambda$</note>:
    $$\omega(x) = \text{pv}[\omega(x)] + \Lambda\times\text{integer}$$
    where $\text{pv}[~\cdot~]$ is the principal value. Then the surface integral around the puncture is also multivalued:
    $$
    I_\gamma = \text{pv}\left[\oint_\gamma dx~\omega(x)\right]+q\Lambda;\quad q\in\mathbb{Z}.
    $$
    Shrinking the puncture to zero makes the principal value vanish, leaving only the quantized term $q\Lambda$
    $$
    I_0 = q\Lambda.
    $$
    Here comes the catch: we still need to prove that the remainder terms do not cancel out and leave $q=0$ at the end. For $\gamma$ being a circle and $\omega$ being a real function modulo $\Lambda$, this is rather easy to confirm. For example, if we consider $\gamma:x\in[0,a)$ and $\omega(x)=q\Lambda x/a$, then we have
    $$
    I_\gamma=\int_0^adx \frac{q\Lambda x}{a}= q\Lambda,$$
    which remains to be this value even after taking $a\rightarrow0$. In this example, $\omega(x)$ crosses the branch cut $q$ times: at $x=\frac{a}{q},~2\frac{a}{q},~\cdots,~(q-1)\frac{a}{q},~a$. Another way to look at this example is to consider $\omega$ to be a map from one circle (with radius $a/2\pi$) to another circle (with radius $\Lambda/2\pi$). Then $q$ counts the number of times the first circle is wrapped around the other circle.
    <br><br>
    Let us try to generalize this statement. Let $\omega$ be a map from a space-time manifold $\partial\mathcal{M}$ onto the group manifold $\mathcal{G}$, then the existence of nonzero topological charge depends on wheter or not we can wrap $\partial\mathcal{M}$ around $\mathcal{G}$ in a non-trivial way. This problem can be catagorized by an object called the <i>homotopy group</i> $[\partial\mathcal{M},\mathcal{G}]$ <cite src="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotopy_group"></cite>. In the previous example, it is known that the homotopy group of a map between two 1-spheres is $[S^1,S^1]=\mathbb{Z}$. This means that all possible distinct ways to wrap the circles can be parametrized by an integer $q$. For a map from $S^m$ to $S^n$, the homotopy group is typically denoted by $\pi_m(S^n):=[S^m,S^n]$.
    <br><br>
    Before we summarize, let us state again that, in $d$-dimensions, we consider $\partial\mathcal{M}\simeq S^{d-1}$. We also note that $U(1)\simeq S^1$ and $SU(2)\simeq S^3$. Mapping onto other non-Abelian groups can be shown to be homotopic to a mapping onto one of their $SU(2)$ subgroups. This is from Botts theorem <cite src="https://inspirehep.net/literature/37141"></cite>. Here is a summarized table of important homotopy groups and their implications:
